This was an assignment from Dr. Xue Guo's Advanced Business Analytics course at UNC Charlotte's School of Data Science. The goal of this assignment was to analyze a Boston housing market dataset to classify and predict whether a property's value exceeded the "median value of an owner-occupied home in Boston". To do this, three predictive models were used: A random forest model, a linear SVM model, and a radial SVM model. The performance of each model was then compared and the best model was selected. A binary dependent variable was used to help classify the property's value. This assignment had some questions to consider...

1.) Summarize the random forest model results. What is the optimal parameter mtry? Provide the variable importance ranking. Do they make sense to you?. Provide the confusion matrix for the validation dataset

2.) For the SVM model, please compare results for two kernel functions, linear vs. radial. Which kernel function leads to a better model performance in the default setting?

3.) Please tune the SVM model with the selected kernel function, and identify the best parameters. Please provide the confusion matrix for the test dataset. What is the optimal parameter(s) for the selected kernel function?

4.) Overall, which method(RF vs. SVM) performs better?

The results and analysis for each model are in the "Boston Housing Market Predictive Model Results" file.
The R script for each model are in the "Boston Housing R Script" file.
